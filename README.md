# My favorite series.
My favorite series is *Pokémon*.
The series' name comes from two words which is **Pocket** and **Monsters**.
In their mainline games, they let you pick your starter Pokémon with the types of:
- Grass
- Fire
- Water

> In other versions of their game, The person is able to pick their starter Pokemon
> that is not in this list. e.g. Pokémon Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu.

Here is a list of all the starter Pokémon across all Generations and regions:
| Generation | Region | Fire-type Starter | Water-type Starter | Grass-type Starter |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
Generation I| Kanto Region | Charmander | Squirtle | Bulbasaur |
Generation II| Johto Region | Cyndaquil | Totodile | Chikorita |
Generation III| Hoenn Region | Torchic | Mudkip | Treecko |
Generation IV| Sinnoh Region | Chimchar | Piplup | Turtwig |
Generation V| Unova Region | Tepig | Oshawott | Snivy |
Generation VI| Kalos Region | Fennekin | Froakie | Chespin |
Generation VII| Alola Region | Litten | Popplio | Rowlet |
Generation VIII| Galar Region | Scorbunny | Sobble | Grookey |
Generation IX| Paldea Region | Fuecoco | Quaxly | Sprigatito |

Every mainline game is unique to each other because of the following elements that differ from each other:
1. Title
2. Starter Pokémons
3. Legendaries
4. Mythical
5. Characters
6. Regions
7. Villain Group
8. Features
